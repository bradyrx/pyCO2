pyCO2
=====

This project is an effort to bring the CO2SYS software to the scientific community that uses python as their main programing language.

The PyCO2 use any two parameters from carbonate system (plus dissolved boron) to calculate all parameters (pCO2, [CO2], [HCO3âˆ’ ],[CO32= ], pH, DIC, and TA) for a given T, S,and P. In addition, the software will asso report the sensitivity of the calculated parameters to uncertainties in input parameters, constants, and etc.
