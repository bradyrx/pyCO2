 Why Python?
------------

Python is an interpreted language that can be run in interactive mode, which
facilitates coding for scientific applications that require use of large
datasets and complex computational programs (e.g. Oliphant, 2007).
Additionally, Python includes a very extensive sort of built-in modules, and
consequently it can be used to run all kind of daily tasks which usually
require more than one language.  The base toolbox for scientific computing in
Python, NumPy-SciPy, introduces numerical arrays in Python providing math
libraries for data manipulation and makes possible the creation of C/Fortran
extensions in an easy straightforward way.  Many Python community modules of
application in environmental sciences and computer science are available.  We
can highlight the following for their relevance in ocean modelling: i) tools
to manipulate the standard data formats in ocean and atmospheric sciences
(GRIB and NetCDF); ii) support for OPeNDAP; iii) tidal harmonic analysis
software; iv) tools for scientific visualisation (in particular matplotlib).
In this manner, the Python language allows to create and operate the model
input/output and to control all the required tasks for the operationally of
the ocean model.
