python-co2sys is an effort to bring the CO2SYS software to the scientific
community that uses python as their main programing language.

The CO2SYS software computes calculates the two carbonate system
parameters given any other two of the four measurable carbonate system
parameters(together with the inorganic carbon speciation and the saturation
of calcite and aragonite).  In addition to the calculated results, the
software reports the sensitivity of the calculated parameters to uncertainties
in input parameters, constants, and etc.
